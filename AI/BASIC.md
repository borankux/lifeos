To design **LifeOS** as a modern, feature-rich Electron app with a focus on best practices and a visually appealing user interface, I’ll break down the app design into several key components, including **UI specifications**, **module functionalities**, **database schema**, **code structure**, and **edge case handling**.

### **1. Application Functionality**

#### **Core Modules**

* **Kanban Board**

  * **Features**: Create tasks, categorize by status (e.g., To-Do, In Progress, Completed), set deadlines, set priorities, add labels or tags.
  * **Database**: Each task has a title, description, due date, tags, and status.
  * **Interactions**: Drag-and-drop task management, ability to edit tasks inline, multi-task selection for bulk actions.
  * **Edge Cases**: Task overlap (two tasks with the same deadline), invalid input for task titles (empty or too long), drag-and-drop errors.

* **Diary System**

  * **Features**: Write markdown-supported notes, with image embedding, audio clips, and attachments. Tagging and categorizing notes.
  * **Database**: Notes have text, markdown-formatted body, tags, attachments (image, audio, documents), creation/modification dates.
  * **Interactions**: Markdown editor with live preview, image drag-and-drop, file upload for media.
  * **Edge Cases**: Unsupported media formats, missing images (broken links), invalid markdown rendering.

* **Habit Tracker**

  * **Features**: Track habits (e.g., morning routine, exercise). Define daily, weekly, and monthly habits. Notifications/reminders.
  * **Database**: Habits have names, frequencies, status (completed/incomplete), and history of completion.
  * **Interactions**: Habit marking system (checkbox), streak tracking, progress bar.
  * **Edge Cases**: Habit streak interruptions, missed tasks due to network failures, setting an invalid habit frequency.

* **Alarm Clock**

  * **Features**: Create custom alarms based on time or habit completion.
  * **Database**: Alarms include the alarm time, triggered habit, and alert type (sound, vibration).
  * **Interactions**: UI for setting and managing alarms, pop-up notifications.
  * **Edge Cases**: Alarm conflict (two alarms at the same time), disabling/enabling alarms.

* **Notebook System**

  * **Features**: Organize notes into different categories (Life, Work, etc.). Store and retrieve data based on categories.
  * **Database**: Categories, note titles, and timestamps.
  * **Interactions**: Category selector, search function, drag-and-drop to reorder notes.
  * **Edge Cases**: Notes with duplicate titles, incomplete note retrieval due to corruption or file loss.

* **Q&A Section**

  * **Features**: Organize questions, track unanswered ones, link relevant notes or tasks for answers.
  * **Database**: Questions have content, category, status (answered, pending), related notes.
  * **Interactions**: Marking answers, linking answers to tasks/notes, categorizing questions.
  * **Edge Cases**: Unanswered questions for extended periods, duplicate questions.

#### **Future Features** (RAG Integration):

* Automate answers based on local data and external APIs. This can be extended to help answer questions in real-time.

### **2. Code Structure**

Here's a modern, scalable folder structure that follows best practices for Electron apps, making it easy to extend and maintain.

```
src/
  ├── assets/            # Static files (icons, images, etc.)
  ├── components/        # Reusable UI components (buttons, cards, etc.)
  ├── containers/        # App views or "pages" (Kanban, Diary, etc.)
  ├── database/          # Database schema, model definitions, and queries (SQLite)
  ├── store/             # State management (using Redux or Zustand)
  ├── styles/            # Tailwind CSS configurations, custom styles
  ├── services/          # Services to interact with external APIs, local storage, etc.
  ├── utils/             # Utility functions (helpers, formatters, validators)
  ├── main/              # Main process code (Electron-specific, app lifecycle)
  ├── renderer/          # Renderer process code (React/Vue components, app logic)
  ├── routes/            # Define navigation, routes for different views
  └── index.tsx          # Entry point for Electron app (main and renderer integration)
  
test/
  ├── components/        # Tests for individual components
  ├── services/          # API and database tests
  ├── store/             # State management tests
  ├── utils/             # Unit tests for utility functions
  └── app.test.tsx       # High-level app tests for integrations and interactions
```

### **3. UI Design Specs**

* **General Design Style**:

  * **Bento-Style**: Use grid layouts and card-based designs to create a clean, organized feel. Each section (Kanban, Diary, etc.) should be displayed in separate grid areas or cards.
  * **Glassmorphism**: Use frosted-glass effects to give depth and enhance modern aesthetics. Backgrounds should have subtle blur effects.
  * **Elevated Cards**: Components like tasks, notes, and habits should be displayed inside cards with elevated shadow effects to create a 3D, floating appearance.
  * **Fonting**: Use **Poppins** or **Inter** for modern sans-serif fonts. Ensure a good line height for readability (1.6x line-height).
  * **Input/Feedback**: Provide clear, rich feedback for input actions. Success messages should have soft green tones, while errors should use bright red. Use smooth transitions for input fields and pop-up notifications.

* **Specific Elements**:

  * **Kanban Board**: Each task is a card. Status changes should trigger smooth animations, like expanding a card on hover and moving between columns with a sliding effect.
  * **Diary**: The markdown editor should feature a clean, distraction-free interface with live preview. Images and files should be draggable, with thumbnails shown beside the text.
  * **Habit Tracker**: Display habits in checkboxes or progress bars. The tracker should visually show streaks and daily goals.
  * **Alarm Clock**: Alarms should have toggle switches to turn on/off. Use large, clear buttons with visual indications (e.g., time, sound type).
  * **Q&A System**: Use collapsible panels to categorize and display questions. Provide an input box for adding questions and linking relevant answers.

* **Colors**:

  * Primary: #6200EE (Purple)
  * Secondary: #03DAC6 (Teal)
  * Background: #121212 (Dark Mode)
  * Card Backgrounds: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) (Glass effect)
  * Success: #00E676 (Green)
  * Error: #D50000 (Red)

* **Transitions & Animations**:

  * Use smooth animations for card movements (e.g., Kanban tasks) and dialog pop-ups.
  * Buttons and inputs should change color on hover with soft, gradual transitions.
  * Use **framer-motion** or **react-spring** for smooth component animations in React.

### **4. Database Schema (SQLite)**

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tasks (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'To-Do',
  due_date TEXT,
  priority TEXT DEFAULT 'Medium',
  tags TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS notes (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  content TEXT,
  category TEXT,
  attachments TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS habits (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  frequency TEXT DEFAULT 'Daily',
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'Incomplete',
  history TEXT, -- store habit completion history as JSON
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS alarms (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  time TEXT NOT NULL,
  trigger_habit_id INTEGER,
  alert_type TEXT DEFAULT 'Sound',
  active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (trigger_habit_id) REFERENCES habits(id)
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS questions (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'Pending',
  related_notes TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### **5. Edge Cases & Handling**

* **Network Issues**: Ensure smooth recovery from network interruptions (e.g., syncing tasks, notes). Display appropriate feedback messages and allow retries.
* **Empty/Invalid Inputs**: Catch empty inputs or invalid data (e.g., title too long, missing due date) and provide real-time validation feedback.
* **Duplicate Entries**: Prevent duplicates in tasks, habits, or questions and show a message indicating duplication.
* **Database Errors**: Handle database read/write errors gracefully with fallback mechanisms and error messages.
* **Inter-Module Dependencies**: Make sure actions in one module (e.g., marking a task complete) properly update related modules (e.g., the habit tracker).

### **6. Summary**

This setup covers the essential **functionality**, **UI design**, **database structure**, and **code architecture** to start building a robust Electron app for LifeOS. As you move forward, make sure to iterate on these specs as you implement each module and improve the overall UX and performance. Would you like to go over any specific part in more detail?
