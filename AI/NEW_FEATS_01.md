- Task selection Part.
  Task selection is now global, it has to be in the kanban board. Place it somewhere proper. Also when a task is selected, it should be persistent. Let the App remember.

- Habits, Now the habits are not working.Can't save habit. Let's make it work and also consider adding habit, editing habit. In the dashboard, Add a habits streak statistics.

- Hiding the already completed tasks is not working properly. When the tasks are finished today, tomorrow, they should be hidden automatically. But I need a way to see them or restore them back to backlogs. 

- Backlog. Other than the three columns, I need a way to add a task to the backlog. First Place tasks added will be the in the backlog. Then moved to todo, then continue. So I need a way to add tasks to the backlog. Backlogs should be per project.


- New Article 
  New article title should be better than this, it's kind of a mess. Too close to the save button. Also The editor is not good enough, I need a better editor, where after I type markdown and spaced or entered, it should be Rendered in the editor. Also in the notes list, the brief description should be rendered, now it's just raw content.



- Kanban
  Kanban some times too long, in that case add a scrolbar for the individual columns. In the details drawer, The time is not working. Fix it, also Add a quick action buttons for the time edtimation, like 5 minute, 15minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hour, half day, full day. This will be used to generate gantt chart in the future. Also when tasks are finished, remember the finished timestamps. So one t ask can have estimated start time, actual start time, estimated end time, actual end time. and actual time spent. And the make the date selector prettier. Also Priority labels, Low is not working, make it work.
  Also when I decide not to do certain tasks, I should be able to add a reason and then move it to the backlog.


  - Editor
  the markdown Editor should support fullscreen, but within the window,show the titlebar. Add shortcuts like ctrl+s for the quick save, also indicate the saving using notificaiton or some owher ways. or add small status indicator showing, it's being changed, or saved, or error.


- Daily Activity Chart
  Now the daily activity chart is not working. Please fix it. I need to see the activites data for ever day. Create a separate database table if you need, but make it work.
